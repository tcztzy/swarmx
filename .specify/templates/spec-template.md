# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Competitive Research Summary *(mandatory)*

- **Reference Doc**: Link to `/specs/[###-feature-name]/research.md`
- **Peer Solutions Reviewed**: [List competing tools/frameworks, link to notes]
- **Adopted Practices**: [Which patterns or guardrails we are borrowing and why]
- **Differentiation Rationale**: [Why SwarmX approach delivers better UX/performance]
- **Open Questions**: [Research gaps that require follow-up before implementation]

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]
- **FR-006**: Solution MUST maintain backward-compatible user experience and APIs within the active minor version (cite mitigation plan if risk exists)
- **FR-007**: Agent behaviors, tools, and routing MUST remain language-neutral by being fully expressible as JSON payloads with MCP-compatible execution hooks (Principle VII).

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-008**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Users can complete account creation in under 2 minutes"]
- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "System handles 1000 concurrent users without degradation"]
- **SC-003**: [User satisfaction metric, e.g., "90% of users successfully complete primary task on first attempt"]
- **SC-004**: [Business metric, e.g., "Reduce support tickets related to [X] by 50%"]
- **SC-005**: [Compatibility metric, e.g., "Legacy CLI workflow remains functional and documented"]
- **SC-006**: [Performance/cost metric, e.g., "95th percentile latency â‰¤ 150ms within $X monthly budget"]

## Compatibility & Migration Analysis *(mandatory)*

- **Impacted Interfaces**: [APIs, CLIs, file formats that must stay stable]
- **Regression Tests Required**: [List failing tests to author before change]
- **Migration Plan**: [Steps, timelines, and documentation for any breaking change request]
- **Rollout Strategy**: [Feature flags, phased release, or beta program details]
- **Cross-Runtime Interoperability**: [Document how JSON agent definitions and MCP tool bridges preserve parity for alternate language runtimes (Principle VII)]

## Performance & Cost Plan *(mandatory)*

- **Baseline Metrics**: [Current perf/cost numbers from benchmarks or monitoring]
- **Target Metrics**: [Goals derived from Competitive Research and Success Criteria]
- **Measurement Approach**: [Tools, datasets, or scripts used to validate improvements]
- **Cost Controls**: [Dependency, infra, or runtime budget constraints to honor]
