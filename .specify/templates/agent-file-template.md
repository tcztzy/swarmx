## Constitution Alignment
- Highlight how current work upholds code clarity, document-driven planning, and test-first delivery.
- Summarize competitive research insights that informed active features, citing `/specs/*/research.md`.
- Record compatibility commitments for the active minor version and any pending deprecations.
- Capture performance benchmarks and associated cost guardrails tracked by the team.
- Describe how agent definitions, tool routing, and execution hooks remain JSON-serializable and MCP-consumable across runtimes.
- Outline how recent commits adhered to the single-intent, validated-increment workflow with links back to tasks or audit evidence.
