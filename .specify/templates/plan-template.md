# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research. Cite supporting documents with links and section anchors.]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Compatibility Commitments**: [APIs/UX that MUST remain stable, planned deprecations, migration notes]
**Benchmark & Cost Plan**: [tooling, datasets, or budget guardrails for measuring performance]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [ ] Documentation updated first: plan.md, spec.md, research.md reflect the intended change set and are linked in this plan (Principle III).
- [ ] Competitive research recorded and referenced: `/specs/[###-feature-name]/research.md` or equivalent doc summarizes peer solutions (Principle IV).
- [ ] TDD workflow defined: enumerate failing tests to write before implementation (`uv run pytest`) and reference their file paths (Principle II).
- [ ] Compatibility strategy captured: identify user-facing surfaces impacted and describe how minor-version continuity is protected or migrations delivered (Principle V).
- [ ] Performance and cost targets documented: include benchmarks, profiling plan, or budget guardrails for the feature (Principle VI).
- [ ] Agent interoperability preserved: describe how agent definitions, tool routing, and execution hooks remain JSON-serializable and MCP-consumable across runtimes (Principle VII).
- [ ] Code quality approach clarified: outline simplifications, removals, or refactors that keep the solution readable and maintainable (Principle I).
- [ ] Commit sequencing documented: break work into single-intent increments tied to compliance evidence so each validated slice can land independently (Operational Workflow).

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
